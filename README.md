- **Minecraft:** 1.21.1  
- **Mod Loader:** Fabric  
- **Java:** 21  
- **Required Mods:**  
  - Fabric API

## 🗡️ Swords
### **Sandai Kitetsu (Rare)**

A cursed blade from a notorious lineage.
This sword does not generate in the world and must be crafted using a Nether-earned cursed ingredient.

### **Wado Ichimonji (Rare)**

A blade that grows stronger through progression and discipline.

### **Excalibur (Legendary)**

A legendary sword that deals bonus damage to undead.

### **Murasame (Legendary)**

A cursed blade that brings inevitable death.

Murasame inflicts a unique lethal curse rather than traditional damage-over-time effects. Any entity struck by the blade will perish after a short delay, regardless of strength.
Merely holding Murasame is dangerous — those unprotected by special equipment will be consumed by the curse themselves.

## ⚠️ Warning
The Murasame Curse is unavoidable once applied.
Without the Murasame Gauntlets, carrying or wielding this blade will eventually result in death.

---

## 🌍 World Generation & Spawns

Most rare and legendary swords are obtained through **world generation** rather than crafting.

- **Excalibur**, **Wado Ichimonji**, and **Murasame** spawn in special structures or shrine-like locations throughout the world.
- These locations are intended to reward exploration and discovery.
- **Sandai Kitetsu** is excluded from world generation and must be forged manually.

---

## 🧪 Cursed Kitetsu Shard

A cursed crafting component used to forge Sandai Kitetsu.

- Drops from **Wither Skeletons** (high chance)
- Rarely obtainable through **Piglin bartering**

---

## 📘 Bladebound Codex

Bladebound includes an in-game **Codex** that documents each sword, its effects, and lore.

The Codex is provided directly to players and serves as a reference for all Bladebound weapons.
